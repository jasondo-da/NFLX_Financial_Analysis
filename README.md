## Project Introduction

This project will be a vertical analysis of the Netflix's year over year financial data under ticker symbol NFLX. First, I will web scrape the public financial data from using the yfinance API. Then I will preprocess and clean the scraped public data and turn it into a structured data source to be ready for analysis. Lastly, I will analyze the income statement and list each line item as a percentage of the total operational revenue to more easily explore how effectively Netflix achieves its financial goals and compares to prior years' performances.

## Analysis Outline

- The most noticeable year-over-year changes within the income statement are the growth in gross profit margin, EBIT, and EBITDA

- From 2022 to 2024, Netflix has slowly increased its gross profit margins from 39% in 2022 to 46% in 2024, showing a 7% increase over 2 years

- This reveals that Netflix is profiting 46% on every dollar made after expenses and is the largest company in the streaming sector by revenue

- EBITDA as a percentage of total operational revenue has been consistent from 2021-2023; however, in 2024, Netflix has seen its largest increase in EBITDA as a percentage of total operational revenue in at least 3 years

- The EBITDA data shows that Netflix has been leaner in 2024 than in prior years, meaning they are profiting more of their total operational revenue this year than in past years. Possibly due to a mixture of increasing year-over-year operational revenue and declining year-over-year expenses.

- EBIT, as a percentage of total operational revenue, has also increased from 2023 to 2024 and has been  growing since 2022

- The growth in EBITDA and EBIT indicates that Netflix has become more efficient with its operations and has strong operational profitability from its core business


## Conclusion

Netflix has generally been doing well operationally from 2022 to 2024. Many other streaming competitors have a gross profit margin ranging from 30-35%, while Netflix increased its gross profit margin from 39% in 2022 to 46% in 2024. Netflix managed to increase its gross profit margins by 7% over the last two years, while already being an above-average industry leader is impressive. Additionally, Netflix has further optimized its operations and logistical planning to become more financially efficient in recent years, increasing year-over-year operational revenue faster than its year-over-year expenses, leading to a 3% increase in EBITDA from 2023 to 2024 after multiple years of stagnation.
